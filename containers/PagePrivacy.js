            <p>
              We understand that your privacy is important to you and are committed to being transparent about the
              technologies we use. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how
              and when we use cookies on our Site.
            </p>
            <b>Do we use Cookies?</b>
            <p>
              Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies, web
              beacons, or pixels and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Site has the best possible
              experience.
            </p>
            <b>What is a Cookie?</b>
            <p>
              A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies
              contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
              Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some
              cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list
              below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web
              beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count
              visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and
              acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics
              providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
            </p>
            <b>Why do we use Cookies?</b>
            <p>We generally use Cookies for the following purposes:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Site, and without such Cookies, we would not be able to
              provide many services that you need to properly use the Site. These Cookies, for example, allow us to

              account and have logged into that account to access Site content. They also include Cookies that enable us
              to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use functional Cookies and Cookies from third parties for analysis and marketing purposes.
              Functional Cookies enable certain parts of the site to work properly and your user preferences to remain
              known. Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect information on how visitors use our Site, the content
              and products that users view most frequently, and the effectiveness of our third party advertising.
              Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to relevant audiences and having our ads appear at the top of
              search results. Cookies are either “session” Cookies which are deleted when you end your browser session,
              or “persistent,” which remain until their deletion by you (discussed below) or the party who served the
