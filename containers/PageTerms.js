            <h2>5. Fees and Payment.</h2>
            <p>
              5.1 Core Plan. A basic tier of Services (the <strong>“Core Plan”</strong>) is provided to you without
              charge up to a certain threshold (the <strong>“Core Plan Threshold”</strong>). Any requests submitted
              beyond the Core Plan Threshold may be limited in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything herein to
              the contrary, (i) you may only use free accounts for personal and non-commercial use and (ii) free
              accounts are not eligible for any support from us whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.2 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. On the first day of each billing period,
              you will pay us the applicable fees (the <strong>“Base Fees”</strong>) and any applicable taxes based on
              the Services in the plan that you selected (the <strong>“Selected Plan”</strong>). In addition, we may, in
              our sole discretion, issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your
              Selected Plan (the <strong>“Applicable Threshold”</strong>) based on your use of the Services during the
              previous billing period (the <strong>“Overage Fees”</strong> and, together with the Base Fees, the{' '}
              <strong>“Fees”</strong>). If you make any other changes to the Services during a billing period (e.g.
              upgrading or downgrading your Selected Plan), we will apply any additional charges or credits to the next
              billing period. The Core Plan Threshold, Applicable Thresholds, the Base Fees for each plan of Service and
              any overage fees (the <strong>“Overage Fees”</strong>) are set forth here:{' '}
              <a href="https://infura.io/pricing">https://infura.io/pricing</a>. We may bill you more frequently for
              Fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the
              Fees for use of the Service Offerings in U.S. dollars. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement
              will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and
              charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we communicate updated fees
              and charges to you, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and
              charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect
              to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on
              all late payments.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.3 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying
              all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions
              thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this
              Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes. We may charge, and you will pay,
              applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will
              provide such information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect
              Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish
              us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we may
              claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement
              will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such
              deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any
              payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is
              equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as
              are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for
              taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.

              Your continued use of or access to the Infura Site or the Services following the posting of any changes to
              this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. We may also, in the future, offer new services
              and/or features through the Infura Site (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new

            <h2>13. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
            <p>
              PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT
              TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy (<strong>“Claim”</strong>) relating in any way
              to this Agreement, the Infura Site, your use of the Service Offerings, or to any products or services sold
              or distributed by Infura will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 13, rather
              than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal
              Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in
              arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
              individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or
              statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be
              conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration
              Rules and Procedures (the <strong>“Rules”</strong>) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this
              Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final,
              binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having
              jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of
              this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or
              a New York state court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state,
              or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
              applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including
              any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
              court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing
              we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
              intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
              INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
              PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.
              Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or
              otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award
              injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
              provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law
              precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then
              that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any
              court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or
              unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration
              provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to
              have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class
              action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the
              following address: Infura ℅ ConsenSys, 49 Bogart Street, Brooklyn, NY 11206 and via email at
              notices@infura.io, with subject line INFURA LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your
              first use of the Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms
              of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we will also not be bound by them.
